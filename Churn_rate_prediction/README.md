Churn Rate or Employee Churn is the overall turnover in an organization's staff as existing employees leave and new ones are hired. Attrition in business describes a gradual but deliberate reduction in staff numbers that occurs as employees retire or resign and are not replaced.E

## Problem Statement

You as a Machine Learning practitioner have been given a task to deal with a critical HR issue - Employee Churn. You are given a dataset and your task is to find the factors that lead to employees leaving the company.<br>

The dataset consists of 34 independent features such as Age, Education, BusinessTravel,	DailyRate,	Department,	DistanceFromHome, etc. The feature 'Attrition' indicated if an employee has left or not.

The following conclusions can be derived:<br>
 
1. What proportion of the staff is leaving?<br>

2. How does Age and Length of Service affect termination?<br>

3. Can we predict future terminations? <br>

<b></b>Note: You can load the dataset in your notebook like this:<br>
```dataset = pandas.read_csv("dataset.csv")```

## Contributing
You can work on this dataset in a Jupyter file ```(.ipynb)``` and upload it in this directory.
