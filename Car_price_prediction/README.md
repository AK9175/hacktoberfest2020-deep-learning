## Problem Statement 

You as a Deep Learning practitioner have been given a task to assist a car seller by predicting the prices of his cars. The dataset consist of following columns:<br>
  
1. Customer's name
2. Email Address
3. Country
4. Gender
5. Age
6. Annual Salary
7. Credit Card Debt
8. Net Worth
9. Car Purchase Amount (Selling price of the car)

<b><u>Note:</b></u> Use ```encoding = 'ISO-8859-1'``` while loading the data to avoid any erros.  
For e.g., ```dataset = pandas.read_csv('Car_Purchasing_Data.csv', encoding = 'ISO-8859-1')```

## Contributing
You can work on the dataset in a Jupyter notebook (```.ipynb``` file), and upload it to this directory.
